## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try before buying?

**Yes!** The free version includes full rank optimization (30-90% compression 
depending on LoRA type). Try it on your workflow, see the results, then upgrade 
to Pro for quantization when ready.

### What if I'm not satisfied?

**30-day money-back guarantee.** If the Pro features don't work for your use 
case, we'll refund you immediately, no questions asked.

### Can I upgrade later?

**Absolutely!** Start with free, upgrade to Pro when you start commercial work. 
Many users do exactly this.

### What counts as "1-10 users"?

One Pro license covers up to 10 people in your organization. If you're a solo 
freelancer, it's just you. If you're a 5-person studio, everyone can use it. 
At 11+ people, you'll need Enterprise.

### Do students/educators need a commercial license?

**No!** Students and educators can use the free version indefinitely, even if 
your school is technically a for-profit institution. Education is education.

We also offer **50% educational discounts** on Pro licenses for students with 
.edu emails. Contact: jonwright.24@gmail.com

### What if I'm a non-profit?

**Registered 501(c)(3) non-profits can use the free version** even for 
organizational work. We support non-profit missions!

### Can I buy one license for multiple projects?

**Yes!** The Pro license covers all your commercial work. One payment, use it 
on every client project forever.

### What about open source projects?

**Open source projects can use the free version**, even if they're used 
commercially by others. The restriction applies to *your* commercial use, not 
your users'.

### Do I need a license for each computer?

**No!** The license is per-user, not per-installation. Install on your laptop, 
desktop, and cloud instances - all covered under one license.

### Can I resell or redistribute the software?

**No.** You can use LoRA Lens for your commercial work (with a license), but 
you cannot resell the software itself or include it in products you sell to 
others. For redistribution or integration, contact us about Enterprise licensing.

### What if my needs are between Pro and Enterprise?

**Contact us!** We're flexible. If you need API access but only have 5 users, 
or you need 15 seats but not the full Enterprise suite, we can work something 
out. Email: jonwright.24@gmail.com
